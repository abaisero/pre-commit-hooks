## Configure pre-commit

Add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your git repo:

    - repo: https://github.com/abaisero/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: main  # or specific git tag
      hooks:
        - id: no-commit


## Two ways to invoke pre-commit

If you want to invoke the checks as a git pre-commit hook, run:

    pre-commit install

If you want to run the checks on-demand (outside of git hooks), run:

    pre-commit run --all-files --verbose

<!-- The [test harness](TESTING.md) of this git repo uses the second approach -->
<!-- to run the checks on-demand. -->


## Available hooks

### `no-commit`

**What it does**

Checks that text files do **not** contain a pre-specified strings (which
defaults to "NOCOMMIT").  This is useful to tag parts of the code which needs
to be revisited before being commited.

**Default**

Filter on files that are `text`, failing if any text file contains the given
tag, which defaults to "NOCOMMIT".

    types: [text]
    args: [--tag=NOCOMMIT]

**Custom configuration (overrides)**

Use the [built-in
overrides](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-configyaml---hooks) from the
pre-commit framework.
